
John has decided to throw a house party for his 30th birthday and he wants to go to the grocery store for shopping.
He has a list of items and constraints he must respect during the shopping. This information is stored into a file where
each line has the following format:

item weight price availability

where item is the name of the item, weight indicates the weight of the product, value is its price, and availability
indicates the maximum availability of that product. The first line of the file indicates the total number of products
(lines) within the file. Notice that weight, value, and availability are positive integers, and that item is a
string of maximum 50 characters.
Write a program that helps John to fill his cart with products such that the total weight does not exceed W, each
product count does not exceed its availability, and their total price (i.e., value) is maximized. The weight W and the
name of the file are passed as parameters to the program. If a solution can be found, the program must print all items
selected with the corresponding count, weight, and price, following the example reported below. If a solution cannot
be found, the program should report an error message.
For example, given the input file
6
water 153 200 2
sandwich 50 60 2
banana 27 60 2
apple 39 40 3
cheese 23 30 1
beer 52 10 3
If the cart capacity is equal to W = 400, then the output would be:
         count weight price
water      2    306    400
banana     2    54     120
apple      1    39     40
solution   5    399    560
